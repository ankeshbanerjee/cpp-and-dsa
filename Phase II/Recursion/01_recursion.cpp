// when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met
// this specified condition is called base condition
// at base case, return is used to terminate the function execution
// the non-completed successive function calls wait in the memory stack
// infinite recursion causes stack overflow
// when the base case is met, the stack gets cleared one by one
