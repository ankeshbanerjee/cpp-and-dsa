* L<N<R
* it should be true for every subtree
* everything on left subtree should be smaller than node, 
* everything on right subtree should be greater than node.

* are duplicates allowed?
* some books say not allowed.
* to allow duplicates, few approaches can be done, such as ->
1. L<=N<R
2. storing nodes in the form of {node, freq}

* why BST?
-> searching in normal tree takes, O(N)
-> is BST, searching takes O(logN)
